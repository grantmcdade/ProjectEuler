# ProjectEuler

A framework for working on the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

Test are inplace to ensure that refactoring does not break existing code. Currently only projects 1 through 59 have tests.

The project uses dependency injection for type dependencies (Unity) and mockups (Moq) for some tests.
